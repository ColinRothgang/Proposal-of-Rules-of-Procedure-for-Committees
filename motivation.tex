The following Rules of Procedure of the USG Executive Committees are grounded in (and inferior to) the Committee bylaws in the USG constitutional document. However, while the USG constitution's Bylaws describe the tasks of the Committees quite well, they lack at describing the concrete procedures by which these tasks are to be completed. Consequently, these Rules of Procedure aim not at modifying or replacing, but rather at extending and interpreting the USG constitution and particularly the existing bylaws and at clarifying the responsibilities and working procedures inside the Committees similarly to the clarifications by the USG Parliament's Rules of Procedure. 
%Acknowledging the added bureaucracy and reduced freedom to organize the Committees induced by any Rules of Procedure, these describe mostly the procedural responsibilities of the Committees and leave them to the individual Committees to decide on a person responsible on a required tasks. 
This way, they can serve as a point of reference for internal procedural disagreements and for education of new members.

%Main purposes of these rules:

%1) To force upon committees to work properly
%2) To have a point of reference to judge members failing to fulfill their duties
%3) To educate new members and to document our current organization for students in the years to come
