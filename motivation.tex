In this section a proposal for Rules of Procedure of the Committees in the USG (at the point of writing: the Academic Affairs Committee, the Campus Affairs Committee, the Financial Affairs Committee) are described. These Rules are grounded in (and are inferior to) the Committee bylaws of the USG constitution (part B, especially article IV). However, we recognize that while the USG constitution's Bylaws describe the tasks of the Committees quite well, they lack at describing the concrete procedures by which these tasks are to be completed. Consequently, these Rules of Procedure aim not at modifying or replacing, but rather at extending and interpreting the USG constitution and particularly the existing bylaws and at clarifying the responsibilities and working procedures inside the Committees similarly to the clarifications by the USG Parliament's Rules of Procedure.
