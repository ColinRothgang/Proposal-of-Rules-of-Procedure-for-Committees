In the USG constitution, the concept of Rules of Procedures is referenced, but not defined. 
We propose to amend the USG constitution (or ratify this change, whenever the constitution is changed again) by prepending the following definition to article X, section 4:

\begin{quote}\emph{
	``Rules of Procedure are complementary provisions of a unit, a committee or the election committee regarding their internal working procedures. Consequently, they don't violate nor affect the USG constitution and existent bylaws which are not themselves Rules of Procedure. They don't affect any other constituency of the USG. 
	Thus, they shall be amended by a simple majority of members of the respective unit or committee and additionally by a simple majority of the USG Parliament.
	''} %\protect\footnote{ The last requirement is demanded by article IV, section 4 of the USG constitution}
\end{quote}
These requirements are met by the above Rules of Procedure by provision \ref{provision:overruling}.\\

The above change of the constitution is not required for this proposal\protect\footnote{and it can't be due to provision \ref{provision:overruling}}, however it would (in the author's opinion) clarify the term "Rules of Procedure" without meaningfully affecting the provisions of the constitution.
